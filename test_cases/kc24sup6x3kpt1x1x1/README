*this is for the work in trueblue:/home/jbk/gulp3.0/newkc24PhononOpt.  
*the first four modes were unstable, so this structure needs to be optimized more and 
this analysis is, technically, invalid.  However, those modes probably arise from 
volumetric instabilities.  Since we have artificially constrained the volume to 
that of experiment (by applying a semi-fictitious pressure?), this is to be
expected.
