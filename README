NEEDED FIXES:

* to fix energy symmetric requirement, get rid of exception and fix wherever crashes (should be a matter of applying detailed balance earlier.  half of the data gets thrown away anyway, so )
* see expSqe._sanitize()
* also remove 0
* figure out where brillouin zones are in data and pick out whole zones for integration (ask O. D.?).
* come up with method to calculate S(q,e) and compare
* warning: this code has cubic space group built into its algorithms 


below is dated?

!!! Create top level documentation !!!
-- use Matt's as a guide ?

- Straight line for elastic cutoff
  - fix the error bars for this.

-  the internal representation of C_ms should match the paper 

Double and triple check expSqe.expand and expSqe.slopeCut.  
Fix up causes of warnings:
  Warning: divide by zero encountered in divide
  Warning: invalid value encountered in divide
  -- You can "GetDos.py 2>/dev/null"

Plotting:
  - What about gnuplot compiled with zlib instead of libgd?
  - Perhaps there should be a separate conf file for plotting stuff?
    - is putting the GDCONF stuff in user.py too ugly??

Clean out some of the test cases?

Edit densityOfStates.py to accept range of possible cutoffs. :)
